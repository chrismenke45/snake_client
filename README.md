# Snake Game Front End
This is the [snake game](https://chrismenke45.github.io/snake_client) I made with React. The backend made with Ruby on Rails can be seen [here](https://github.com/chrismenke45/snake_api)

## How it's made:
Tech used: React.js, Vanilla CSS
## Optimizations
I could have made this code a little cleaner. The Snake, Board, and Space classes follow OOP principles but are hard to understand without an in depth review.
## Lessons Learned
This got me back to using React after taking a front end haitus to learn Ruby on Rails. It reminded me that state in React is immutable and allowed me to build my first React component that updates based on time.
